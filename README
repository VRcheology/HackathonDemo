This VR project was created (under the title "VRcheology") for the Seattle VRHackathon IV Sept 16-18th 2016 (http://vrhackathon.com/seattle.html)

The goal was to pull data from opencontext.org

Anyone, anywhere! Unearth real ancient artifacts and the amazing stories behind them in virtual
reality.

We provide students and archaeology enthusiasts an explorable world. Unearth Etruscan artificats
in VR Italy to learn about the teachers of our teachers.

Are we doing something crazy awesome? We are utilizing a real data source in real time! We
build living history in VR with archaeology, and in archaeology with VR. Reciprocity!
