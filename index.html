This VR project is an interactive visualization of the Poggio Civitate artifact data from OpenContext. Artifacts are "buried" underneath the ground according to the provenience data. With the HTC Vive VR headset, users move around the environment by using the pressing the controller trackpad, aiming where they wish to go, and releasing the trackpad to teleport to the targeted location. Users can excavate these artifacts by moving the Vive controller up and down over the ground surface.
